## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00001 - Create meta module structure and FrankAPI namespace classes

### Summary
Created the meta/ module with FrankAPI class providing synchronous namespace-based access to Frank Bot actions. All six namespaces (calendar, contacts, sms, swarm, ups, time) are implemented with stub methods that will wrap the existing async actions using asyncio.run().

### Files Changed
- meta/__init__.py
- meta/api.py
- meta/executor.py
- meta/introspection.py

### Learnings
- The existing action handlers follow a consistent pattern: `async def action_name(arguments: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]`
- Each action accepts an arguments dict and returns a dict with `message` and domain-specific data
- The namespace methods mirror the action parameters but use explicit keyword arguments for better IDE support
- executor.py and introspection.py are placeholder files for future tasks (frank_bot-00006 and frank_bot-00007)

## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00002 - Implement CalendarNamespace with sync wrappers for existing calendar actions

### Summary
Added comprehensive unit tests for CalendarNamespace that verify the namespace methods correctly wrap the underlying async calendar action handlers. The tests mock the action layer to avoid requiring actual API credentials while verifying parameter passing and return value handling.

### Files Changed
- tests/test_calendar_namespace.py (new)

### Learnings
- The CalendarNamespace was already implemented correctly in task frank_bot-00001 - the "stub methods" mentioned in that task were actually full implementations using asyncio.run()
- Unit tests should mock at the action layer (`actions.calendar.get_events_action`) rather than at the meta.api layer since the imports happen inside the methods
- Tests verify: parameter passing for all method signatures, default values, return value passthrough, and FrankAPI integration

## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00003 - Implement remaining namespace classes (contacts, sms, swarm, ups, time)

### Summary
Added comprehensive unit tests for all remaining namespace classes: ContactsNamespace, SMSNamespace, SwarmNamespace, UPSNamespace, and TimeNamespace. All namespace implementations were already complete in meta/api.py from task frank_bot-00001, so this task focused on creating tests to verify the wrappers work correctly.

### Files Changed
- tests/test_contacts_namespace.py (new)
- tests/test_sms_namespace.py (new)
- tests/test_swarm_namespace.py (new)
- tests/test_ups_namespace.py (new)
- tests/test_time_namespace.py (new)

### Learnings
- All namespace classes were already fully implemented in task 00001, not just stubs
- SwarmNamespace.checkins() has the most parameters (11) including: year, after_date, before_date, category, with_companion, companion_match, only_with_companions, has_photos, include_photos, max_results, stale_minutes
- TimeNamespace.now() accepts a timezone parameter for future compatibility, but the underlying action doesn't currently use it
- UPSNamespace.status() takes no parameters and returns runtime, charge_percent, and temperature_f
- SMSNamespace.send() requires both recipient (name or phone) and message as positional arguments
- ContactsNamespace.search() requires query as a positional argument with optional max_results
- Tests follow the same mocking pattern as CalendarNamespace: mock at the action layer since imports happen inside the methods

## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00004 - Implement script storage and parsing utilities

### Summary
Implemented script storage and parsing utilities in meta/scripts.py. Scripts are stored as .py files with timestamped filenames, and docstrings are parsed to extract metadata (description, parameters, example). Created comprehensive unit tests covering docstring parsing, filename handling, and CRUD operations.

### Files Changed
- meta/scripts.py (new)
- tests/test_scripts.py (new)

### Learnings
- Script filenames use filesystem-safe ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ (colons replaced with dashes)
- Python's ast module is reliable for extracting module docstrings even without executing the code
- Docstring parsing needs to handle both "Parameters:" and "Args:" section headers
- ScriptMetadata dataclass provides clean abstraction for script information

## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00005 - Implement job storage and management

### Summary
Implemented job storage and management in meta/jobs.py. Jobs track script executions with status (pending, running, completed, failed, timeout), capturing params, stdout, stderr, result, and error. Created comprehensive unit tests for all CRUD operations.

### Files Changed
- meta/jobs.py (new)
- tests/test_jobs.py (new)

### Learnings
- JobStatus enum extends str for JSON serialization compatibility
- Job filenames use pattern {timestamp}-{slug}-run.json to distinguish from scripts
- Auto-setting completed_at for terminal statuses (completed, failed, timeout) simplifies update logic
- Jobs are sorted by started_at descending for newest-first listing

## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00007 - Implement introspection module for meta documentation generation

### Summary
Implemented the introspection module in meta/introspection.py that generates Markdown documentation from FrankAPI by inspecting namespace classes. Documentation includes quick start example, execution workflow, method tables for all services, and usage notes.

### Files Changed
- meta/introspection.py (updated from placeholder)
- tests/test_introspection.py (new)

### Learnings
- Python's inspect module combined with get_type_hints() reliably extracts method signatures
- Pipe characters in Markdown tables need escaping for valid output
- Documentation structure should match API discovery workflow: quick start -> execution -> services -> notes
- Code fence counts must balance (```python + ```json = ``` closers)

## 2026-01-29: frank_bot-00013 - Ensure data volume is mounted in Docker configuration

### Summary
Updated docker-compose.yml to mount ./data:/app/data volume for persisting scripts and jobs. Added DATA_DIR environment variable for container path configuration. Updated README with data directory documentation.

### Files Changed
- docker-compose.yml
- README.md
- meta/scripts.py (updated DEFAULT_SCRIPTS_DIR to use DATA_DIR env var)
- meta/jobs.py (updated DEFAULT_JOBS_DIR to use DATA_DIR env var)

### Learnings
- Using environment variable (DATA_DIR) with fallback to relative path allows same code to work in both Docker and local development
- Docker volume mount ./data:/app/data provides persistence across container restarts
- README project structure should document the data/ directory for discoverability
